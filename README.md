# User Notes

## Description
Zendesk app to create and add and show notes to Zendesk users. The notes are stored using Sunshine data structure.

This app is built on top of the [Zendesk App Scaffold](https://github.com/zendesk/app_scaffold). Follow the steps in that repository to run the app locally or deploy.

The goal is to offer a scaffold for people trying to experiment with Zendesk apps and using the powerful Sunshine APIs.

## Sunshine

The [Zendesk Sunshine](https://www.zendesk.com/platform/) platform lets you connect and understand all your customer data wherever it lives. The Sunshine platform is independent from other Zendesk customer service tools such as the product APIs, the Apps framework, and the embeddables. The Sunshine data layer is not associated with any Zendesk product, though you can model relationships with certain native objects like tickets and users.

## Installation

The user notes are saved using Sunshine data structure. Follow [these article](https://develop.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002127707) to enable Sunshine in your account.
